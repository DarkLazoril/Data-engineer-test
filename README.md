## No deep nuclear science here, simple as it could be.

### Prerequisites

First you need to install the necessary dependencies of the python script you want to execute. 
These dependencies are listed at the top of the script file in the import statements of each python file. 
You can install all required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install [library_name1] [library_name2] [library_name3]
```

Replace `[library_name1]`, `[library_name2]`, and `[library_name3]` with the actual names of the libraries needed for the script.

### Running the Script

now you run the script, by using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python filename.py
```

Make sure to replace `filename.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

### And That's it, see told ya no nuclear science here!
